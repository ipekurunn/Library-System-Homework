# Library System 

This project is a console-based Java program that simulates a library system. 

A library contains media, and media consists of books and music records. The Media class has title and genre parameters. It also keeps track of how many times an item has been borrowed and whether it is currently borrowed or not. Where as a book has an author, a music recording has a produceras a person object parameter. In addition, a library member is another person object that can borrow any type of item from the library.
In view of the descriptions above, the menu method prompts the user with the following options:
1. Add new book to the library system
2. Add a new music recording to the library system 
3. Add new member to the library system 
4. For a given genre, it will display all media items in the library 
5. View the most borrowed books and music recording 
6. For a given person object, it will indicate whether it is an author or a producer
7. Save all new media items and members to the text file
